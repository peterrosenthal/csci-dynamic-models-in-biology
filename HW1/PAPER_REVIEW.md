# Paper Review: Design and self-assembly of two-dimensional DNA crystals
Part two of this homework assignment is to review the following paper: [Design and self-assembly of two-dimensional DNA crystals](Winfree_Nature_1998.pdf).

The main takeaway from this paper, to me, was that the researchers were able to exhibit control, all the way down to the level of controlling the periodic order of monomers, over a self assembling polymer lattice. The level of control is a  really important part, but so is the self assembly part. These are molecules that they can create by just putting the right ingredients in solution at the right time, no fancy steps needed, the lattice forms itself and all of it's exactness on it's own. DNA was the molecule of choice for these self assembling lattices, because of the existence of antiparallel double crossover (DX) DNA molecules, which form particularly rigid junctions. These rigid junctions from the DX molecules are what gives the lattice it's shape and strength. Different DX molecules, have different bonding points, which leads to the customizability of "Wang tiles," which in turn drives the customizability of the whole lattice.

In this paper, they created periodic lattices with periods of 2 and 4 parts, which they referred to as `AB` and `ABCD` lattices respectively. The strongest part of the paper to me was their use of "DNA hairpin sequences" inserted into the `B` components for the `AB` lattice, and the `D` component for the `ABCD` lattice. This made those components of the lattice physically taller/larger so that they, and as a result the periodicity of the lattice, were visible using AFM imaging. This resulted in figures 3 and 4 of the paper, which were so exciting to me because they helped make everything "click" and make sense in my mind how things were coming together. Another really cool (to me) thing from these figures was the directionality of the rips that would occur in the lattice. The researchers say this is a result of there being almost 6 times as many "sticky-end" bonds in the vertical direction as in the horizontal.

I thought that this was quite the exciting/interesting paper to read, and am having a hard time thinking of the weakest part. To me, I guess I just wish that they had explored creating three dimensional crystals instead of just two dimensional lattices. But all work has to start somewhere, and they even acknowledged that as a direction to take this research in the future in their "Applications" section. Another way that the paper could have maybe been improved, was if the most exciting figures, 3 and 4, were more accessible (sooner in the paper). I think it's important that they have enough context to be as exciting as they were, but I don't think they needed it to be as late as it was; figure 1 had plenty of context, and figure 2 as well as the accompanying text section, could have maybe been swapped in position with figures 3 and 4. But then again, I'm not a scientist in the relevant field to this paper at all, so maybe just because figure 2 wasn't so important to me, doesn't mean it's not important to the paper.

Because to me, the weakest part of the paper is that they didn't explore 3D, of course 3D is the direction that I most desire to see this work move in the future. Along with 3D (and probably instrumental in working towards 3D), I'm also futurely excited for self assembly of aperiodic structures that they mention in that section. I think it's super interesting that we could be able to code something into these structures, or write a novel into a structure, and to have an actual physical and spatial relic that is entirely unique to it's encoding.
